Hello all,

Yesterday as member of Microsoft Insider program I installed on my dev machine new Windows 11! Oh... 

<!--more-->

And I may say its OSM! 
And that is more important for us - mRemoteNG on Windows 11 with all its bugs and features - working same way as in Windows 10! ![cool](https://reklama-no.ru/smiles/cool.gif)

So I may say technicaly mRemoteNG is Windows 11 compatible, so you dont need to worry about will it work once you update - yes, it will!!!
